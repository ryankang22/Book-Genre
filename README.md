## Introduction 
Perform text-classification to classify and predict book genre. The dataset consist of the book id, book title, plot summary and book genres. Each book belongs to multiple genres. 

## Model 
To approach this problem, i have decided to implement a multi-label model. In particular, i have chosen to implement a multilabel KNN model with GridSearchCV to obtain the most optimal parameters.
